      <h1>React</h1>
      <h3>Tutorial rápido</h3>
      <p>React apps are made out of components. 
        A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) 
        that has its own logic and appearance. 
        A component can be as small as a button, 
        or as large as an entire page.</p>

       <p>components are JavaScript functions that return markup:</p> 

       <img src="Group.png" alt="Descrição da imagem" width="600" height="400">

        <p>Now that you’ve declared MyButton,
           you can nest it into another component:</p>

           <img src="Group.png" alt="Descrição da imagem" width="600" height="400"> 
        <p>Notice that <MyButton /> starts with a capital letter. 
          Thats how you know its a React component. 
          React component names must always start with a capital letter, 
          while HTML tags must be lowercase.</p> 

          <p>Have a look at the result:  </p>

          <img src="Group.png" alt="Descrição da imagem" width="600" height="400">
          
          <p>The export default keywords specify the main component in the file. 
            If you’re not familiar with some piece of JavaScript syntax, 
            MDN and javascript.info have great references.</p>

            <h1>Writing markup with JSX </h1>
            <p>The markup syntax you’ve seen above is called JSX. 
              It is optional, but most React projects use JSX for 
              its convenience. All of the tools we recommend for 
              local development support JSX out of the box.
            
            JSX is stricter than HTML. You have to close tags like. 
            Your component also can’t return multiple JSX tags. 
            You have to wrap them into a shared parent, 
            like a div or an empty >.../> wrapper:</p>
           

    </main>
  </body>
</html>
